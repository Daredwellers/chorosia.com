# Chorosia - About Us

## Who We Are:

Chorosia is a metal band from Vienna, Austria, formed in 2017. Our music is best described as progressive sludge, although it mixes elements of doom, psych, grindcore, death, and even folk at times. Elevated caveman riffs together with tribal drums and growling vocals – if you're into that, you'll dig what we have to offer. We focus on raw energy and use it to explore beneath the surface. We play the music we want to hear, Iommosphere is where we dwell.
