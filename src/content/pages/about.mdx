Is it progressive sludge or is it death/doom? Maybe post-sludge? It's quite unclear what genre niche we belong to but it sure is heavy. 

We are a four-piece band from Vienna and genres were never our thing. Our music is kind of heavy and weird, unpolished and unpredictable. It’s about defiance, frustration, (mis)understanding, loss, and occasional moments of strange beauty and encouragement buried beneath all that distortion.

Our self-titled debut album was released in 2018. Raw, DIY, and recorded with whatever we had back then, it got picked up by a few underground outlets so we started gigging around Austria and nearby countries. That included opening for acts like Crowbar, Dopelord, Black Tusk, The Skull, Deafkids and aftershow gigs for Neurosis and Yob.

The second album, A Call to Love (2021, Grazil Records), pushed things way further, both musically and emotionally. It’s a strange record featuring folk parts, blast beats, clean vocals, grind sections, and slow doom anthems. People didn’t really know where to put it, but two words that summed it up were mostly "**Beautiful**" and "**Weird**". 

Our most recent EP, Stray Dogs (2023, Grazil Records / Kvlt und Kaos), expands even more into that discomfort like a 35-minute punch in the gut. Critics have called it "**Vicious**", "**Disturbing in a good way**", and "**A sludge metal masterpiece**". As Toilet ov Hell put it: “Chorosia is a band fluent in chaos”.

We're just four fellas making music that we want to hear, gigging and touring, dragging our big amps across the old continent. Think caveman riffs, but the caveman has just become self-aware.
