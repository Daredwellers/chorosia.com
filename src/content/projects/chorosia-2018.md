Released on May 27 in 2018, "Chorosia" (aka "Self-titled", or "Chorosia I" sometimes) is our first album. Recorded only 6 months after existing as a band, the self-titled debut is full of raw, unpolished, and sometimes improvised ideas. Much like the albums that came after, "Chorosia" was recorded by us in our rehearsal room. The recording project started out as "only demoing for the studio", however, after liking the end result we've decided not to wait any longer and put out this thing that represents our true sound.

The drums were recorded in a day and a half, with the help from our friends Baris Tosun and Michael Trupke. All the rhythm guitars were done in a single day and the bass tracking did not take longer than an afternoon. Vocals, leads, and acoustics were most likely done over a couple of days before heading into the mixing phase which took weeks. 

The cover art was done by our friend Maxim Schapow and it beautifully represents the idea and the vision we had in mind while coining all those wicked stories and theories about the Priestess of Doom and the mean Reptoids.

Yet to be published on vinyl, the physical copies are only available on CDs.
