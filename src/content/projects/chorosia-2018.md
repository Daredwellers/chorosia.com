Released on May 27th, 2018, “Chorosia” (aka “Self-titled”, or “Chorosia I” sometimes) is our first album. Recorded only 6 months after existing as a band, the self-titled debut is full of raw, unpolished, and sometimes improvised ideas. Much like the albums that came after, we recorded the album by ourselves in our rehearsal room. The recording project started out as “only demoing for the studio”, however, after liking the end result we decided not to wait any longer and put this thing out and let it represent our true sound.

Greg nailed all the drum tracks in a day and a half, with the help of our friends Baris Tosun and Michael Trupke. All the rhythm guitars were done in a single day and the bass tracking did not take longer than an afternoon. Vocals, leads, and acoustics were most likely done over a couple of days before heading into the mixing phase which took some weeks.

The cover art was done by our friend Maxim Shchapov and it beautifully represents the idea and the vision we had in mind while coining all those wicked stories and theories about the Priestess of Doom and the mean Reptoids.

Yet to be published on vinyl, the physical copies are only available on CDs.
