Released on September 15th, 2023, "Stray Dogs" represents what we believe is our true sound and identity. Is it prog-sludge, post-sludge, prog-doom, death-sludge-doom, or something else? We don't know and it does not matter. "Stray Dogs" is definitely our most personal release up to date. The album title has a lot to do with Anto's personal background but also our collective views on the world, humanity, and ourselves too. You can read Anto's personal thoughts about "Stray Dogs" here.

With 4+1 songs and a length of just over 35 minutes, we decided to call it an EP but it absolutely feels and plays like a full-length. Once again, the whole production process was taken care of by the band under Anto's helm - this time purposefully minimizing the amount of takes and any studio polishing to represent the most truthful sound of Chorosia yet. Lo and behold, this was our best-sounding album so far, in our humble opinion. 

Cover art was done by none other than the great Orion Landau, known for his previous work with bands such as Inter Arma, Yob, Russian Circles, Red Fang, and many others (simply check out Relapse Records.)

"Stray Dogs" is available on vinyl, CDs, and cassettes.
