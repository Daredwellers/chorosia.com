After releasing "A Call To Love" and still not being able to embark on a proper tour in 2021, we decided to film and record a live session to present our new songs to a wider audience. Practically titled "audio.manufaktur Live Session" comprises of 4 songs, 3 of which from the most recent album at the time. 

Recorded live at audio.manufaktur Vienna and filmed by Lukas Rosatti and Elias Eisner on September 25, 2021. Cover art DIY. 

Available only in digital form.
