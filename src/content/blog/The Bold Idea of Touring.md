Hey peeps!

Weâ€™re super excited to let you know weâ€™re heading out with our buddies Thosar once again next month. Supporting their new album release, weâ€™ll be tearing it up in four different countries from October 16th through 25th. You can check the dates below and make sure to come by and hang out with us if youâ€™re nearby.

On the other hand, itâ€™s our pleasure to tell you we started tracking instruments for our new album. Weâ€™re taking it slow, and we canâ€™t really say when weâ€™re going to release anything, but the good news is weâ€™ll probably play a bunch of these new songs on this tour. So thatâ€™s another reason for you to come and join the party.

Take care and see you in the pit! ðŸ”¥
